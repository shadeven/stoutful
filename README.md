# Server
This is the server component of the Stoutful project, which hosts the API. The server is built off of node and express.js.

## Getting Started
Run `npm install` to download all needed dependencies.

To start the server you can simply run `sails lift` or `node app.js`.

## Localtunnel
We use localtunnel in order to expose your local running server to the public domain of the web. This makes development on mobile easier since we don't need to use local IPs. To use localtunnel, visit http://localtunnel.me/ on usages.
